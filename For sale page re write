so I have my old website with a "for sale" section that just consists of a list off items with paypal buy-it-now buttons.
I found a nice template with a layout that I like and wish to turn that into my new forsale page.

can anyone on here do that? 
How much would you charge?
How long will it take?

my forsale page:

The new template that I found:

A picture of how I want it to look and function:
