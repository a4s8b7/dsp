Can you still make patterns for molds? I was thinking about making a mold for my invention, and then finding someone to run the mold for me. That way there I can have my invention as a product that I can sell.

I still have to 
1>Draw up the blue prints for the mold.
2>have to figure out howto run the coolent for the mold.
3>Make the pattern
4>Get a steel mill to make it into metal.
5>Have the mold machined. (tool and die) (maybe I can get my dad to do this part)
6>Test the mold.
7>get run time on a press
8>Start marketing the invention.
9>sell sell sell


I'll need to find out how much it will cost to have the mold poored at a steel mill, I 
beat it will be a-lot$.
Making the ejection rods and the coolent holes would be exspensive too.

Anyway I'll take this invention slow, so that I can do a good job on it. My 
aplication for a patient is allready at the patient office. All I have to do now 
is wait for that to go thought ( and get approved). The patient office said that it 
ussally takes 2 years for an approvial or denied. But if I can find some one that can 
help me make the invention, then I can start selling it earlyer as patient pending. :)
