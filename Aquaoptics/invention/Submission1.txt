The Problem
Cotton and Carbon type cartrages are Plaged with a big problem, Once the cotton fills up with gunk, the
water over flows up and over the filter cartrige instead of though it, causing the filter to stop working.
You can rinse out the filter cartrige and reuse it but, you can only re-use them so many times.
After a year of filter cartrige replacements the coast of the replacements adds up.

Wouldn't it be nice to own a filter system that dose not need cartriges.
One that can be ignored for weeks on end.
