This pond is buit by Andrew Buczko, creator of Dungen Studeos. Having built 
three ponds before this one he has come up with the best filtration and tank 
systems to use with ponds, even going as far as to design and build his own 
filter and pump system.
</p>
The following web pages will take you on a tour of the ponds built by Andrew
and the trail and errors of each one. We will also introduce you to some of the 
fish and animals that we have had living in the ponds.
