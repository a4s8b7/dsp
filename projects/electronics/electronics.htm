This Keyboard was giving to Dungeon Studios as payment for<br>
some Electronic work that we did. (yes he found this<br>
keyboard in the dumpster) So more than half of the keys<br>
were broken. When opened we discovered that someone had<br>
spilled soda into the keyboard. After re-soldering the<br>
entire keyboard and giving it a bath in cleaning solution<br>
the keyboard slowly came back to life. As far as the broken<br>
keys go, that was a mechanical problem and was easyally<br>
fixed by replacing 35 springs. We did some reserch and it<br>
turns out that this keyboard is from the 1970's. Some time<br>
In the 1970's Roland ether bought out Seil or took Seil<br>
over. If you look closer you can see a resemblance to the<br>
early Rolands.<br>

This web page was made to document the PC keyboard. It<br>
works by holding the mouse pointer over the button and<br>
reading the H tag. This HTM file forms the CIRCUIT DATA<br>
SPECIFICATIONS for a PC keyboard layout.<br>

<font color=white>This is Dungeon Studio's Nintendo 64 controller<br>
that Andy modified to have an Air Cooling System<br>
That would keep your hands from sweeting during<br>
those tough action packed games. Andy would have<br>
done some more with this controller but, the<br>
controller was stollen from him and that was that.<br>
he could make a new one but now he has lost<br>
intrest. The next time Dungeon Studios builds one<br>
we'll install an electronic shock mechanise to keep<br>
people from stealing it. <u>"A real killer would of<br>
imediantly of asked (whats the little red button for?)"</u>.<br>
If you want one like this, pay Dungeon Studios $50.00<br>
And Andy will make you one. That dosn't include the<br>
price of the controller.<br>

My friend and I are working on our own Nintendo game.<br>
The big deal is that we are writing the game in Assembly.<br>
Right now we are using an emulator to test the game ROM,<br>
but when the game is ready we will use this Test Cart<br>
to test the game.<br>

<font color=white>This is My really Kool CLICKY Keyboard with a built in two <br>
inch Track Ball. This Keyboard was giving to me by a friend. <br>
The track ball didn't work and the keyboard was fithy dirty.<br>
I got the track ball to work and decided to keep the keyboard.<br>
To fanchy things up I decided to paint it. If you look closser<br>
you can see that the sides of the keys are painted silver while<br>
the keyboard itself is metalic blue.<br>

Here is a Slot Car controller that I'm working on for the 1/24<br>
scale slot cars. The koolest part of the controller is that<br>
red button on the end. The button acks as break peddal. When<br>
you press the peddal it removes power from the track and shorts<br>
out the motor. With the motor shorted its causes dynamic braking<br>
The button is wired up so that you DON'T have to remove your finger<br>
from the throttle. This allows you to maintain the same speed when<br>
you let off the brake.<br>

This is my USB hard drive enclosur. It has a 40gig hard drive and<br>
a 7 port USB hub. It was suposed to have the CD-Burner but it turns<br>
out that HP never wrote a driver that will work with this burner and<br>
a IDE to USB converter. I had to install the CD burner in my PC. The<br>
Drive bays of this unit were modified and now have rubber stand-offs<br>
for better dampering. My friend and I added the handle to the top of<br>
it to make it easyer to cary.

After many years of searching I have finnally fond me a Video Beem<br>
Projector. I had first seen one of thease at a friends house. Turns<br>
out that his dad fixed one but then got to keep it. I got mine for<br>
$75.00 as is and lucky enough all three ray guns worked! I acually<br>
took and made a Rail system in the ceiling to hold this brut. I am<br>
able to move the whole unit forward and back to help focuse the image.<br>

For the screen I used an 8foot by 7foot piece of<br>
felt. This wasn't the best materal but it worked.<br>
I had everything hooked up so that no matter what<br>
I was watching I could see it on the 8 FOOT WIDE<br>
SCREEN! You can play Nintendo, Playstation and scarry<br>
movies on it. Right now the Video Beem Projector is<br>
in storage since I can't hang it up in my appartment<br>
(I don't think they want to see holes in the ceiling<br>
and roof joist).<br>

<font color=white>This is one of the guitar speakers that was made by<br>
Dungeon Studios. It features 3 speakers, a 25watt amp,<br>
sturdy hard wood construction and a Black light. The<br>
three speaker design was chosen because those were the<br>
speakers that were in stock. The added Black light was<br>
installed because black lights are kool. In total only<br>
7 of thease speakers were made. Three of witch were sold.<br>

The speakers were valued at $250 each. When placed on<br>
EBay the speaker only sold for $40. It was bad marketing<br>
on Dungeon Studios part but then again EBays not the best<br>
for Car sterios and Amps. At the time of the sale there<br>
were alot of amps that looked like they were hot. For<br>
example some one had 12inch rockford fosgate speakers for<br>
$20.00 buy it now, when we all know that they are worth<br>
$100 each. This gave buyers the idea that all music stuff<br>
should be $20 regardless of quality or legal sales. Dungeon<br>
Studios is planing on keeping the 4 remaining Amps.<br>
