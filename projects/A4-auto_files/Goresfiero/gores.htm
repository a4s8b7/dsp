Jason's Fiero is a second owner Fiero with  relatively low mileage considering its age (1985).
The intererer was in perfect shape. Nothing like the other cars that we've seen were the dashboards are chiped, 
vinyl is warped and the seats are torn. I remember the first time I took a ride in it, The 
stareo had a white Zombi tape stuck in it. His Fiero was a four cylinder with an automatic 
transmission. 
</p>
<p>
He drove the Fiero only in the summer until the brakes went out. One of Jasons friends was 
supposed to fix the brake lines for him but they didn't do anything besides removing the old 
lines. So the Fiero sat in his friends yard for three years before being towed to Jason's 
house and then again to someone elses house.
</p>
<p>
Well there was a divorce and some money came about, so Jason, me(Andrew) and Dan (with the 
help of Tim's garage) started to work on converting Jason's Fiero into a 3.4Liter V6 with 
a 5 speed manual trasnmission.
</p>
<p>
-Work started with buying a 3.4L V6 engine from a junk yard. <br>
-Then Jason bought an intake with value covers. <br>
-Next we bought a "donnor" engine so that we would have all the brackets that we'll need. <br>
-Jason bought a fly wheel but then had to return it since it was the wrong one.<br>
-Jason bought flywheel #2, this time the right one.<br>
-We then found a car with the 5 speed tranny that we needed, but the guys at the junk yard torched all the wires, mounts and cables<br>
-bought new used shift cables<br>
-new used tranny mounts<br>
-new used rear axles<br>
-new cluch line<br>
-new cluch (yes, they broke the cluch!)<br>
-bought a diffrent ECM (computer for the 2.8 V6)<br>
-cluch pedal and assembly<br>
-cluch master cylinder<br>
-2.8 V6 wiring harness<br>
-
</p>

We did some of the engine work at Jasons house, put on the intake, swapped brakes arround. 
Later we brought the Fiero to my house so that we could work on some of the heavy stuff. We mounted 
the starter on the opposite side of the motor. Hooked up the 2.8 wiring harness to the motor. 
We did try to use the coil pack from the 3.4L motor but that prove to be to much work. We put
in the HEI distribitor instead. When the engine was all together we did a test run with the 
engine sitting on the floor, No exshaust just headers. It was awsome. Fire shot out the exshuast
headers!

Ok so now the cars at Andys house. we disconected everything on the engine craddle and the engine,
then lifted the engine and tranny out using an overhead crane. (theres is now a foot print on the 
roof of Jason's car). (we pulled the engine and tranny up out of the top of the car together at 
the same time). With the motor and tranny out we pushed the car into the drive way, diconected the 
subframe and the jacked up the car. We removed the subframe with the struts still attactched, then 
left the car there up on blockes.

In the garage we installed the 5spd tranny to the 3.4L engine and then installed the whole thing to 
the sub frame. We installed a new Flow Master exhuast system. New Brake rotors from the Fiero Store.
With everything on the sub frame we were ready to install it back into the Fiero.

To get the car back into the garage (remember the Fiero has no rear tires now) we lowered the back 
of the car onto a palet jack and rolled it into the garage. Then we lifted the Fiero by the strut 
holes with the overhead crane. (this crane lifted Jasons Fiero right off the ground!) We moved the sub 
frame and engine assembly underneath and lowered the car down on it. When the Fiero got close to 
the sub frame, we propped the car up with the jack and removed the cranes chain from the strut mounts.
We moved the jack arround to help line up the bolts holes, striped one nut but, everything is in!.

Now its the teadyous task of hooking everything back up. Wires, radiator hoses, pullys, air - 
conditioning, vacum houses, wire harness, dog bone, ground wires.....<br>

Problems? well we had some problems.. For starters, The brakes were not just bad, they were gone!
We could not get anyone to fo the brakes for us. We would tell them about the car and ask them if 
they can fix the brakes but, they would just say "its sounds like you guys are capitale of fixing 
them yourselfs, besides, brakelines are easy.". So we had to replace the brake lines our selfs. 
All the way from the master cylinder to the brake hoses. And it was a Bastard all the way! Every-
thing had to be replaced and nothing would fit together! It felt like it took 2 weeks and 16 trips
to autozone just to get them done. It wasn't "EASY" they just didn't want to do it!
</p>
<p>
Another problem we ran into is that the axles for the automatic are shorter with smaller CV-Jionts
than the axles for the standard transmission. So we had to buy new ones. $270.00 from buckeye 
autoparts but, we were lucky. We found some used ones for $40.
</p>
<p>
A big problem was in the eletrical system. it turns out that Pontiac installed all of the wires in 
each and every Fiero. I'm talking about the main cable that runs from the engine compartment to the 
fuse box. So wether or not your fiero came with a standard, automatic, v6 or strait 4, the main wire
harness has the wires for it. So, if you want to to change your 4cyl for a V6 well then most of the 
wires are allready there. theres just one problem. The main harness has three of each colored wire, 
none of then are labeled. so its a big guessing game!

One easy part of the conversion was Restoring the gas tank. Gores gas tank was all rusted 
underneth and the brackes were shot. I made up some new brakets out of scrap metal. Ground and 
Sanded down The rust. Then treated the tank with Rust Converter paint.
