<h3>Well to put it simple...<br>
We took some spare Bike parts.<br>
<a href="bike-01.jpg"><img src="tbike-01.jpg" alt'junk'></a><br>
<hr><br>
Then choped it all up, bent and welded, to make the new frames and stuff.<br>

This is one Bike that we made, It was supposed to be a montain bike but we<br>
could not get the shock to work properly.<br>

<hr><br>
Here is the little bike shed were all the stuff is stored.<br>

It also makes for a good work shop.

We can't foget my old GT, with the trailer!<br>

Of course Andy painted it, looks good.<br>
This bike is an old GT that my dad and I modified to have<br>
12 speeds and a trailer. The trailer is great since it can<br>
hold an good 300 lbs or more, and with the 12 speeds on the<br>
bike you can acually pull it! Its also fun to give your friends<br>
rides on it.<br>
