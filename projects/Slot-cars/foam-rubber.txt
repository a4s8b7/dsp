Hello Andy here at Dungeon Studios prototyping
I am looking for low density foam rubber to use on my next product.

This is what I'm looking for:
--12 x 12 x 1 inch or 24 x 24 x 1 inch
--16-20 Density Rating
--colors: orange, yellow, white and black (foam must be the same color all the through)

I want the foam in sheets so that I can cut out the shapes that I need.
Thanks
Andrew S. Buczko
