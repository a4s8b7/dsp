<img src="fish-1.jpg" align="right">This is the Dungen Studeos Koi Pound Filter It<br>
was designed by Andrew Buczko, Using parts that can be found at your local hardware<br>
store.<br>
Most Pound filters have to be speacaly made or<br>
need to be ordered from some far away land. The<br>
filters design is simmiler to common types of<br>
filters. So thers no magic there, its in the fact that<br>
its EASY to buy and to build. So any fish owner can have one.<br>
