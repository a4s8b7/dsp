<!mri>ITS A NEW IDEAR FOR TRANING AIR FORCE PILLOTS WITHOUT HAVING TO 
TAKE OFF. Its been around for years now and still, not many 
people know what it is. So why re-design a hole new simmulater instead 
of buying one. I have looked at many difrent types of flight simmulaters
and have found that they don't fully simmullate the fealing of flying.
Some of the simmullaters that have shown up in arcades are slow, have 
limmitted movement, poor sound quality, or just bad play control. There 
have been some successes, like the "After Burnner 2" game that hade a 
seat that tilted back and fourth and side to side. There was also a toy 
that my local arcade barrowed for a copple of days that looked like it 
was from the movie lawn mower man, I didn't go on it since the price they 
charged was out-raggese "maybe thats why they went out of bisness". My 
freind went on it and said that it was the coolest thing he'd expereance.

<!MRI>My design is a new uniqe combanation of computer controlled moters, 
hydrolics,game systems,suround sound,and a amazing new easy upgradable 
coptpit, that can feture anything from VHS monitors to VR. glasses(virtual 
reallitty glasses),and (this is its best feture) any type of control 
apperaittise your company wants. Now we all know nothings free, so when I 
designed the flight_simm, I plan to use parts that are high in quality and 
low coast. So far the most expencive coponet that you can buy for this system 
is the Motors and Controllers. The motors can be made very simple but then 
you would lose control Quality. The motors and controllers I plan to use will 
probly coast about $7000.00. I better save my pennys. But on the bright side,
A Super Nintendo and game can coast you $200.00 (1992) thats cheap! Where as 
a Computer System can coast you $5000.00. So the price is realy up to how much 
you want to spend. The system will be able to surport both computers and game 
systems. The system is to be relesed in late 2020. The price will change 
drasticly in the next few years or so. Look for more details in future articals.
