I took the trains motor apart, tested the coils for continuity. 
cleaned all of the contacts. re soldered the contacts for the wires. 
replaced the two light bulbs with new bulbs. socked the trucks for about 
two weeks to remove the rust that froze up the wheels. Disassembled the 
reversing unit and scrubbed the drub clean with contact cleaner. carefully 
scrubbed clean the revering units pickup shoes using a non-abrasive head 
cleaner with contact cleaner. Once the trucks were free, I oiled and 
re assembled the bottom half of the train. Then I ran the train in a 
circle to "wake it back up" then I put all the parts back on the train.
 Now, this engine will pull itself. ussally I have to start it off with 
it set in the forward direction, once it warms up, then it will start 
working correctly "forward, stop, and reverse". Now if you have a wheel 
puller you could replace the rubber on the wheels since those are hard as 
rocks. I hope this answers your questions :)
