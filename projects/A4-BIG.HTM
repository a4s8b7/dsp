Check out how I've converted this Power Wheels Big Foot into a gas powered gocart. I started this<br>
little project when a niehbor down the road from<br>
me was throughing one out.After checking our<br>
inventory of parts, I Whent and asked for the old<br>
toy, Sure enough he gave it to me. Since then,<br>
We've renforced the frame , added new<br>
axles (frount and back), Took out all the old<br>
electronics, and added a<br>
gear box and drive shaft.</h3></p><br>

The cover is still the original cover, but it needed to be<br> repainted and modified. The<br>
front end had to be completly cut out (except the<br>
sides) to fit in the new<br>
engine.The body monts had<br>
to changed too (from the<br>
cover to the frount axle). The<br>
rest of the cover was sanded down and painted.<br>

The Gokart can't take alot of abuse (due to its small<br>
frame and Wheel base)<br>
So I plan to use it as a show Gocart in /car<br>
shows/fairs/and mybe some parades.<br>
<br>
2004 update, this project has been put on hold since the drivetrains transmission has gone Kaput. Its currently buryed in the shed.
