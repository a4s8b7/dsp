When I (andy) lived in Coneticut, Me and my brother built a big tree fort in the tree by 
the driveway. Our friends Peter and John helped us build it. I had started this fort by 
trying to build a platform up in the tree. It didn't work so I took it down. The tree wasn't 
just one tree, there were three trees all growing right next to each other. While growing 
up we had climbed and played on those trees so we new just about every knot on them. Since 
my platform idea did not work we tryed using all the trees and we came up with three platforms 
(or floors) that could be made.

The tree fort was great, we toped ot off with a peaked roof (complete with shingles). The
third floor was insulated with stiraform so it stayed nice and warm during the winter with 
the help of two or three candels.

This tree fort used to have an elevator that ran up the front of the fort. There were two 
twenty foot long two by fours That giuded the elevator up and down all three floors. It used 
a block and tackel to go up and down. The elevator itself was only 2'wide x 2'long x 3'high 
so we only used it for equipment and not for people. One day when we were not home some of 
the kids in town decided to go play in it, when they tryed to lift a kid up in the elevator 
the rope snaped and the elevator came crashing down. The kid wasn't hurt he only fell ten 
feet but we told all of the kids that they were trespassing. As for the elevator, I never 
put it back up because I couldn't affored to buy another 100' rope.

The secound floor was complete with three walls but it didn't have a door to close off the 
space were the elevator was. The secound floor had a nice glass window, cedar wood floor, 
and a sheilf that was built into the wall.

Now the first floor wasn't much of a floor. (3' x 4' i'm geussing) But I built it since there 
was a spot there that worked good. Even though this floor has no walls it still worked good 
as a place to hide for games like hide and go seak or laser tag and water balloon fights.

Now as every body knows I now live in ohio. When we moved from CT we had to take the tree fort 
down. While taking the fort down we filmed the demolition. The master copy of the demolition is 
two hours long. It took me, and my father just to get the roof off. The thing is, is that we had 
to leave the trees and the fort was build so well that we had to take it apart piece by piece.
I plain on making a highlighted film of the Tree Fort Demolition. So be sure to check the link 
below for the film.

As for our friends Peter and John. Well they still had a place to go to, to hang out. Before I 
moved we built a TeePee out in the woods. It was covered with old plastic tarps and had a fire 
ring in the center. Johns dad also let him use the atic of the shed as a hang out place. Of all 
the forts that my friends and I have built I liked this tree fort the best.
