Many times in my younger years I have always wanted to own and 
play with thease great (totally awsume) Radio Controlled cars.
Luckly enogh for me A older boy scout gave me 2 of his used (and 
pretty beat up) cars. From those I was able to build one car that
worked (sort-of). When I went to high school, My bus stop was 
right in front of the pawn shop. My friends and I were always 
the first to get the best deals. Thats were I found all of the 
cars and parts to fuel my hobbie.

On this page you'll find plenty of pictures showing off my RC cars.
The cars are not for sale but I will answer any qeustions that you
might have about them.
