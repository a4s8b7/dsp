<p>Experienced electronic, electrical and computer repair technician, looking for a reliable career that fits my training and experience, as well as offers an opportunity for advancement. I am skilled in high voltage electrical circuits, electrical and industrial electronics, digital electronics, and computer electronics. I am looking for a position where my skills and knowledge can be tested, and put to use.
  I enjoy designing and building anything. I studied electronics at Oliver Wollcet Technical School in Connecticut for two and a half years.  Then I moved to Ohio where I graduated early from Columbian High School. To continue my education, I attended Terra Technical College where I have earned an Associates Degree in industrial and digital electronics.</p>
