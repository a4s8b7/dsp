Hello and welcome to Dungeon Studios. Dungeon Studios<br>
was made up so that we would have a production name for<br>
our movie that we made (Elmos 21). We dicided to call it<br>
Dungeon Studios, because all our equipment was located in the<br>
basement, and wasn't worth crap. We like to make home<br>
movies and funny skits. We also work on side progects<br>
(look in Dungeon Progects to see some of them).<br>

  My first web page was hosted by yahoo, on one of there free web pages.<br>
  at first there wasn't much up there. <br>
  <br>
  -I had a gallery of about 12 pictures<br>
  -A geust list that was called (death certificats)<br>
  -A bunch of animated gifs<br>
  -A list of bands.<br>
  -computer programs that were never posted.<br>
  -A big list of hardware that if someone wanted it, they could email and ask to buy it.<br>
  <br>
  This is how the page stayed for some years. I did a bunch of updates to the page but<br>
  nothing would really work. One big addition that worked was the guest book but, Yahoo<br>
  had control of the CGI bin so there wasn't much that I could do with it.<br>

  One big break through was when I got my page registered with some no-name search engine.<br>
  This acually provided some hits to my web page. I had my page listed with yahoo search<br>
  but it didn't show up in any of the results unless you spelled the name Exactly.<br>

  There were problems with my web page graphics not loading. I thought it was just Yahoo's<br>
  server's being down. At least thats what I thought for a long time. Later on I learned<br>
  that my page only had so much band-width and once that band-width got used up Yahoo would<br>
  stop loading my page. So it seamed that everytime someone would go to my page it would<br>
  use up all my band-width in that one visit. hahahaha, oh wait, that joke was on me...<br>

  So the page really dosn't work. I started working on the web page locally. I had a ton of<br>
  stuff added to my page. It was looking great but no one else could see it. By now I had<br>
  started selling stuff on ebay alot.<br>

  A friend of mine started his own web hosting service and after helping him with fixing his<br>
  car he gave me some web page space. Now my web page is hooked up. I can do uploads from home.<br>
  Having a Local server allows me to edit web pages right at the server. I have full controll of<br>
  all CGI PHP and html programs.<br>

  My page still lags in current updates, but I have been active with Akroncdnr with there web<br>
  page designs and have helped them with work on rent-a-coder.com. Those pages are geared to<br>
  making money were-as my page is geared towards showing off.<br>
